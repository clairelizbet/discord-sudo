Control access to admin privileges on your server with Sudo for Discord.

Trusted members of your guild can use `/sudo` to temporarily gain admin access when needed, preventing accidental administrative actions (e.g. reordering channels).

## ⚙ Setup

↕ After adding the bot, place the auto-created `sudo` role **above** the admin role you would like the bot to manage

![To do this, go to Server Settings > Roles and drag "sudo" adove the admin role](https://i.imgur.com/DxKcOVq.gif)

🔑 Next, choose which users or roles have permission to use sudo in Server Settings > Integrations > Sudo

## ℹ Usage

### `/sudo`

> Temporarily grants admin access.
>
> Parameters:
>
> - `duration`
>   - How many minutes to grant admin access for
>   - Optional
>   - Valid range: `1` to `120` (default `5`)
>
> The bot will either use the admin role you've configured or attempt to find an admin role that it has permission to manage, preferring those with "admin" in the name, and assign that role the guild member calling the command.

### `/privileges drop`

Alias: `/unsudo`

> Immediately drops your admin privileges.

### `/sudo-config`

> Manages Sudo for Discord configuration.

#### `/sudo-config set-admin-role`

> Sets the role assigned when granting admin.
>
> Parameters:
>
> - `role`
>   - The admin role to grant (bot must have permission to manage the role)

#### `/sudo-config enable-admin-role-autoselect`

> Causes the bot to use any available admin role when granting admin. This is the default behavior.

## 🛠 Running a private instance

🌐 There is a public instance of the bot that you can [install in your guild](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=984508139472838656&permissions=268435456&scope=bot%20applications.commands). This is the recommended way to add the bot.

If you would rather self-host the bot, you will first need to create an app in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Then you can run Sudo for Discord either containerized with Docker or using Node directly.

### 🛳 Using Docker

Set the `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables for the app in your container manager or host.

Then run the container, attaching a persistent volume and passing the environment variables.

```sh
docker run \
  -e DISCORD_CLIENT_ID -e DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET \
  --mount source=discord-sudo-data,target=/app/storage \
  clairelizbet/discord-sudo
```

### 📦 Using Node

To run using Node, your host machine will need **Node 16** installed.

```sh
# Installs third-party packages the bot depends on
npm install
# Compiles TypeScript to JS that Node can run
npm run build
# Optionally, remove dev dependencies
npm prune --omit=dev
```

After setting the `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables, run the bot with `npm start`
